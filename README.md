# Election-Analysis
## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Elections employee assigned the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes for each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
7. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total.
8. Determine the county with the highest turnout..

## Election-Audit Summary        
1.In the election analysis, you will be performing mathematical calculations as well as getting non-mathematical data from a file. 
2.Like lists, tuples can be used to store data; however, you can only retrieve data from tuples. 
3.how to retrieve data based on whether a condition is true or false. Retrieving data based on a condition is known as a decision statement. Decision statements are widely used by programmers because they often need to retrieve data from a large dataset that meets certain criteria.
4.The data consists of a number for the ballot ID and a name for the county and candidate, respectively. 
5.Using the election data, you will need to determine the total number of votes cast in the election. Using the code from the previous day, Tom will show you how to programmatically count up all the votes cast in the election by amending the code below the for loop.
Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
